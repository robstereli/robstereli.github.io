						<h2>Exposing college student homelessness with a documentary</h2>

								<p></p>
								<p> <b>Context:</b> 2017 saw multiple media reports of college homelessness in places like UCLA and Cal State. 
									To reveal the impact of the housing crisis on Berkeley students, Berkeley Rent Stabilization Board charged its interns to collect similar stories on campus. 
									I led the research efforts and the production of a documentary. 
								</p>
								<p> <b>Process:</b> By conducting secondary research, we compiled news reports and understood relevant legislation. Through social media and phone, we then talked to 6 (formerly) homeless Berkeley students. We eventually made a documentary sharing 2 unique perspectives.  
						
								</p>
								<p><b>Results:</b> We made these authentic student stories into a documentary and held a screening on campus, generating conversations both within the University and in the City. The film has since garnered 5K+ online views, and is currently used as discussion material in Berkeley classrooms.

								<p>A common journey of homeless students at UC Berkeley: students who end up homeless are turned away during three critical interfaces with the campus institution. They do not have on-campus housing; they have maxed out of their financial aid package; they are not aware of the Basic Needs Committee, which would serve as the last defense. 
								</p>
								<p>These findings not only shaped the documentary-making process, but also informed the panel discussion at the on-campus screening.

								<h2>Filming locations were chosen in collaboration with homeless students as a way to achieve mutual trust.  </h2>
								<span>Co-creating interview setting</span>	
								<p>
									Creating an interview setting that is comfortable to the interviewee is critical. When given the opportunity, 
									Leo chose without a doubt  chose to meet at the Black Studentsâ€™ Resource Center - where he worked and socialized. 
									The fact that he felt comfortable with the space contributed to the success fo the interview. 
									Tavi was homeless at the time and was staying at a motel 30 miles away by the kindness of strangers. 
									While she was determined to share her voice on the topic, she was concerned about transportation and keeping Nut, her cat, safe. We called her a Lyft and encouraged her to bring Nut. 
									<br>
									<br> 
									For other interviewees such as the Dean of Environmental Design, Assistant Chancellor and Director of Financial Aid, Student Advocate, and Director of Basic Needs Committee, 
									the interview locations were chosen to be at their offices for convenience.

						<h2>Retrospective</h2>
						<div class="detail">
							<p> Making this documentary boosted my creative confidence. With no prior experience in visual storytelling, I had found it daunting to direct and produce a documentary on such an important issue. 
								Fortunately, I was able to recruit talented student filmmakers and even a film scorer to collaborate on this project. Through collaboration, I found my voice as a creative person.
							</p>
							<h3>What I learned</h3>
							<p> <b>Storytelling as an agent of change</b> <br>
								It is through telling a coherent and compelling story that we were able to get to the finish line. 
								When we started the project, we didn't have a film crew. Neither did we have a budget. 
								What we did have is a strong belief in our mission: we are making this film to humanize the notion of student homelessness, and to spark conversations and raise awareness.
								It is by sharing and pitching this narrative that we were able to recruit external partners such as members of the <a href="https://caldka.org/">DKA cinematic professional fraternity</a>, without whom this documentary wouldn't be possible. 
								In retrospect, leading our endeavors with a compelling story is the genesis of our impact.
							</p>

							<h3>What I'd do differently</h3>
							<p> <b>Create opportunities for co-creation</b> <br>
								While there are many things I would do differently from a film's producing and editing perspective, 
								the big conceptual change I'd make is that I would invite the interviewees to co-create the film with us.
								If the objective of the documentary is to highlight homeless students' voices and humanize their experiences, 
								then an approach marked by co-creation and collaboration might lead to better results. 
								Ultimately, it might be more effective to empower our interview subjects to decide the interview formats and editing styles. 
								Maybe instead of a traditional Q&A format, they would prefer an activity that shows rather than tells. 
								Maybe instead of an editing logic that sequentially explores effects, journeys, and proposed solutions of homelessness, students would choose to highlight different aspects of their experiences.
								The point is, our approach did not make space for them to directly shape their own stories. We could have and should have extended an invitation, at the very least.
