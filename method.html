								<p> <b>Context:</b> Method is concerned about the environmental impact of their soap pumps. 
									With more than 30 components, pumps are not recyclable. I was part of an ambitious project to find alternatives to soap pumps.
								</p>
								<p> <b>Process:</b> As an end-to-end project, we first conducted research to understand key factors that make a pleasant cleaning experience. 
									Using these key metrics like control and one-handedness, we redefined the challenge as redesigning the dispensing experience. We then carried out prototyping and usability testing for alternate modes of dispensing.

								</p>
								<p><b>Results:</b> Through multiple iterations, we delivered 2 product solutions, including product designs, marketing strategies, as well as financial analyses.

									The goal of user interview was to understand people’s habits and preferences for using soap and cleaning in general. Key ideas developed during this phase, such as no waste and sense of control, became critical metrics for us to iterate designs on.

								<h2>GoPro recordings showed that people almost invariably clean dishes with a sponge. This inspired us to consider dispensing mechanisms that also serve as cleaning tools.   
								</h2>
								<span>Inspiration from non-participatory observation</span>
								<p>By collecting footages of people washing dishes, we were able to notice patterns that would be ignored otherwise. 
									The fact that every participant used the sponge to do dishes made us realize that the cleaning experience should be viewed as a whole. Pumps on dish soap bottles would have little value without sponges. 
									This insight inspired us to design a product that would dispense and clean at the same time.</div>

								<h2>Organizing our inspirations into categories alongside clients’ existing initiatives helped us focus on innovative and high-impact ideas.</h2>
								<span>Converging on one area</span>
								<p>Our whiteboard session produced more than 30 ideas, spanning from product design to service design. 
									To better keep track of our inspirations, we organized them into 3 main categories: recycling solutions, product solutions, and refill solutions.
									 We also categorized our clients’ existing sustainability efforts, which gave us a sense of where more work might be needed. </p>
								<p>We presented our inspirations laundry list and the diagram on the left to our client during the first monthly meeting, 
									which helped us focus on two aspects: 1) maintaining liquid formulas while exploring inverted dispensing; 2) developing alternative product forms.</p>

								<h2>Tinkering and testing existing products helped us better design alternative dispensing experiences.
								</h2>
								<span>Prototyping</span>
								<p>To make our ideas more concrete, we ordered a dozen inspiring products, tinkered them and studied their mechanisms. We used and tested these products ourselves and made notes of the specific features, noticing how well existing solutions
									satisfy the design metrics we developed through user research. 
									 </p>
								<p>Through tinkering, we realized some of our ideas are simply different versions of existing solutions.</p>

								<h2> Converging on two product solutions, one more radical than the other.
								</h2>
								<span>Project deliverables</span>
								<p>The first design, “Back to Earth Scrub,” is at once a soap dispenser and a cleaning tool. 100% compostable and free of plastics, it has a bamboo compartment to dispense solid formulas, 
									and a refillable loofah scrub to allow for precise application of dish soap. For this idea, we created two low-fidelity prototypes.</p>
								<p>The second design, “Gravity-powered Bottle,” similarly voids the need for a pump and uses one type of 100% recyclable plastic. To account for the desirable one-handed experience, we envisioned a stand that would squeeze the soap bottle upon downward pressure.
									This is the product experience that is closest to Method's current dispensing mechanism, thus may be implemented in the short run.</p>

						<h2>Retrospective</h2>
							<div class="detail">
								<p> 
									This project is meaningful to my design career because it shows how design could be leveraged to create impact, specifically in a commercial setting. 
									It perfect captures the theme I desire for my career: leveraging design to do good at scale through business solutions.
								</p>
								<h3>What I learned</h3>
								<p> <b>Prototyping and research are not exclusive</b> 
									<br> Prior to this project, I used to see research and prototyping as completely separate functions 
									to be carried out by differently specialized people. 
									I thought it's researchers' job to generate insights, and designers' or engineers' job to prototype. 
									However, this project showed me that prototyping is a valuable skill even for researchers. 
									One shortcoming of our team is that we lacked the capability of making high-fidelity prototypes. 
									We were able to conduct robust UX research, develop relevant design metrics, and even make detailed illustrations, but 
									at the end of the day, it was strenuous for us to make realistic working prototypes for usability testing 
									(we eventually got help in 3D printing from our client, but that dependency limited our creative potential). This experience motivated me to develop my 
									prototyping skills, both digital and physical. While I see myself specialized in studying human preferences and behaviors, I do think it's important to 
									develop that breath of skills and become capable of high-fidelity prototyping.
